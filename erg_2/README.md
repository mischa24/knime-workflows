# ⚖️ KNIME – Assignment 2: Normalization Methods

## 📌 Objective

This task focuses on exploring the different **normalization techniques** available in KNIME, particularly within the **Normalizer** node.

---

## 🧪 Methods Identified

Inside the Normalizer node configuration (under the *Methods* tab), the following techniques are available:

- **Z-Score Normalization (Gaussian)**
- **Min-Max Normalization**
- **Decimal Scaling**

These methods are commonly used in data preprocessing to scale values into a standard range or distribution.

---

## 📄 Notes

- This is a theoretical/exploratory task based on reviewing the Normalizer node options.
- No actual workflow was required for this task, but the available options were confirmed via the interface.

## 🛠 Tools

- KNIME Analytics Platform
- Normalizer Node
